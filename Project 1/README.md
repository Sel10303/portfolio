This project is split into three parts: the first part is based on creating the string class we regularly use with C++ using the cstring class. The second part is based on finding whether each given set of numbers create a polindrome, so if they have a structure defined as 12344321 as an example. The third part of the project is based on parsing given tweets based on unique users, their hashtags and the total number of tweets.
