This project is on recursion and backtracking. Sat_solver uses backtracking in order to find a valid solution to a boolean expression. If a certain variable results in the whole solution being incorrect, the algorithm backtracks and sets that variable to the opposite of what it was set before, either true or false. If both assignments results in the whole expression becoming false, that means there is no solution.
Sentences uses recursion and backtracking in order to create sentences. The input file provides us with verbs, adverbs, adjectives, and pronouns. In this case, the aim is to not find a valid answer but find all answers, so we backtrack in order to evaluate all possibilities of a sentence.
