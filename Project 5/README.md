This is a project designed to mimic twitter functions such as searching for multiple hashtags, getting feeds and adding tweets.
The heap.h part of the project is designed to create heaps without using the built in methods of c++. The heap is created with a vector and gets the structure of a heap through the consecutive calls to the heapify function. Instead of organizing tweets with the regular built-in methods, I now organized tweets using heapsort. Additionally, the system now detects the tags the user use. If both users are following each other, when a user tags the other to his/her tweet, it shows up on the other user's feed. However, if the user is not following the user that has tagged his/her, the tweet does not show up on his/her feed. Furthermore, if the tweet does not start with the tag, it does not show up on the other user's feed regardless of the follow factor.
