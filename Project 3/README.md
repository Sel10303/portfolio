This is a project designed to mimic twitter functions such as searching for multiple hashtags, getting feeds and adding tweets. The users are able to search through hashtags. They are able to use the AND or OR operators to search through as many hashtags as they want. The program then outputs the tweets with the given hashtags. After the program ends, each user's feed is displayed in separate files. Their feeds include their own tweets and the tweets of the people they follow. These tweets are organized according to their date. Some sample input and output files are provided in the file. The .dat files are the input files and the .feed files are the output files.
