This is a project designed to mimic twitter functions such as searching for multiple hashtags, getting feeds and adding tweets.
The heap.h part of the project is designed to create heaps without using the built in methods of c++. The heap is created with a vector and gets the structure of a heap through the consecutive calls to the heapify function.
